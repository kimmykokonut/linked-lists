# This is a basic test setup for Epicodus Code School for the computer science unit

### Goal: build small logic-based applications to try out new concepts. These applications will not have a UI. Instead, we will use a test-driven environment with JavaScript to build out these applications.

### Setup:
* Make a new repo with this template.
* Clone the new github repo to your local directory using `git clone 'url-from-clone' `
* On your local computer, navigate to the working project directory, in the terminal, type `$ npm install` to setup the Jest Testing environment

### Testing:
In the working project directory of the terminal, type:
`$ npm test` to run Jest
